## Node

Install the latest LTS version of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/). Version 8.x of Node will be used for this book.

Node comes with node package manager (npm).

```

## Visual Studio Code

---

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It's my code editor of choice. It's awesome. Check it out (or don't, any code editor suited for web development will work).

## Google Chrome

---

[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), with [React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en) installed, will be used throughout this book for viewing and troubleshooting React code.
